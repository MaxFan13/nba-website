The header and footer use a navy blue background with white text that go with the colors of the NBA. The main body also uses an off white color that gives it a distinct look. Some sections like the header and footer also have different padding creating a varied look around the page. Links are colored in a custom yellow to make a better contrast and make the pop out more. Some elements like images and the navigation also have custom margins to create more space in between them.
