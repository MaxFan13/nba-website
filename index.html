            The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the premier professional basketball league in the world, featuring 30 teams from the United States and Canada. Established in 1946 as the Basketball Association of America (BAA) before merging with the National Basketball League (NBL) in 1949, the NBA has since grown into a global sports powerhouse.

            The league is divided into two conferences: Eastern Conference and Western Conference, each containing three divisions. The regular season runs from October to April, with teams playing 82 games before advancing to the NBA Playoffs, where the top eight teams from each conference compete in a knockout-style format. The winners of the Eastern and Western Conference Finals face off in the NBA Finals, a best-of-seven series to determine the champion.
